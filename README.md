# Task guidelines

## Objective:
You are to build an application based on your best front-end knowledge and experience. Consider it as the first step towards building a complex system in which code maintainability, readability and reusability are of paramount importance. Your code, as well as architectural and design decisions will be assessed during the task review.

## Estimated time: 
No more than 5 hours. Itâ€™s not crucial to complete every aspect of the application. You can write a summary of what you would do and how if you had more time to work on this project. Adding some notes regarding the decisions you made during work would be much appreciated."

## Technical Stack:
Application should be JavaScript/TypeScript based.

## UI & UX: 
Application should be easy to use, accessible, and with a clean and readable UI.

## Technical aspects: 
All technical aspects, including data to use, are described in the README file located inside the api directory.

## Task overview
Your task is to build an application, where user should be able to:
1. access the main view displaying a paginated (20 records per page) list of system users, described by: name, username, email (email field is unique for user data).
2. access the details view displaying additional user information for each system user - by clicking on a record on the list view or by changing URL.
3. return to the main list view from the details page by clicking a `back` button. If he came by clicking on a list record, he should return to the same part of the list, with that record highlighted.
